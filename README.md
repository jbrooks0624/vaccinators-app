# Vaccinators App
## Introduction
We wanted to create an application that allows people to get their vaccination status validated by a government database, so that it is harder to fake being vaccinated. This project won First Prize at the Hack-In-Place 3.0 Hackathon!

## Frontend
The app frontend is built using React.js with the addition of Material-UI for styling and Redux + Redux Thunk for state management. The app also uses QRCode.React for real-time QR code generation. Interaction with API endpoints is done using Javascript's built-in fetch() method. 

## Backend
Our backend is primarily python that interacts with data from a sqlite database. Our backend communicates with our frontend via Flask.
